# Syncsys-WinClient

## What is it

This is the Windows client of the Syncsys project. You can find its packing scripts [here](https://github.com/PelerYuan/Sysync-WinClient-Installer), and the server repository [here](https://github.com/Tommy-Zhang3759/Sysync-ConfigServer). 

Now, the whole software is made in Python, **without any usage of third party library**. We are now considering to rebuild it by other programming languages, the first option for us is Go.

To get a basic overview of the features, please go *Overview*.

To get to know the usage of this software, please go *How to use*.

To get to know the detailed information of how it works, please go *How it works*.

Now, the software is still being developed, and does not have many features. For the developing scheme and work progress, please see *TODO*.

The software works by responding to API requests that the server sent. For the whole API list, please see *API List*.

This project is developed by two senior high school students, with the great help and support from their computer science teacher. For more information, please see *Authors, License, Acknowledgements*.
