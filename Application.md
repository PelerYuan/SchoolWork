**Dear Teacher,**

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to formally request permission to use the school's computer lab during evening self-study periods on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays from today until November 7th.

Currently, senior student Tommy Zhang is responsible for assisting the computer science teacher in managing the lab and working on project development. As he is about to graduate, I need to take over all of his current responsibilities before November 7th. The tasks are numerous and complex, requiring me to spend a significant amount of time learning. Additionally, I need to write and record development documentation, which is a large workload. Therefore, I am applying for regular access to the lab during this period to complete my work.

I assure you that I will work diligently in the lab, and you are welcome to check my progress daily. Once all handover tasks are completed, I will also present the results of my work to you. I kindly request your approval for this arrangement.











**尊敬的老师：**

​	您好！

​	我想申请从今天到 11 月 7 日前，每周星期一，星期二，星期五晚自习去学校机房的许可。

​	张宇滔学长目前负责协助计算机老师管理机房和进行项目开发。由于他即将毕业，因此，我需要在 11 月 7 日前接手他目前所有的工作。工作内容很多，较为复杂，需要我花费大量时间学习。同时，我还要进行开发文档的撰写和记录，任务量很大。因此，我申请在这段时间里可以经常去机房进行工作。

​	我向您保证我会在机房认真工作，并且您可以每天检查我的工作。在一切交接工作完成后，我也会让您看到我的工作成果。恳请您的批准！
